## <b> WOLF3D: </b><br>
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
Wolfenstein 3D is a seminal game in the pantheon of early video games. Developed by
Id Software by the über famous John Carmack and John Romero, published in 1992
by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the
history of video games.
Embodying the American spy Willian “B.J.” Blazkowicz, the player attacks and decimates the Nazi army (and another army of zombies while he is at it) with the support
of destructive weapons one more lethal than the next. At the peak of the Story, William
finally faces off an Adolf Hitler, equipped with no less than four Gatling guns and a
robotic protective armor... A true wonder of storytelling, violence and historical details.
This project uses the raycasting technique used in Wolfstein 3D.

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>

-This is a project I made for Codam(42 Network). 
-The pdf of the subject can be found in the repository.
-This was a group project (two people).

## <b> Makefile commands: </b><br>

```
make
make re
make clean
make fclean
```
- Usage:
```
./wolf3d [valid level]
```
## <b> Levels </b><br>
A valid level consits of 1's and 0's. 1 is a wall and a 0 is floor. 
You can use a different key for the floor as wel. This way other options can be implemented later on.
Every row has to have the same amount of caracters and they need to be seperated by at least on whitespace.
level1 level2 and level3 are valid levels that can be altered without having to recompile the program.

## <b>Controls: </b><br>
You use the Arrow keys to walk around.
ESC will quit the program.
